# Smart-Mirror
Custom built smart-mirror running off a Raspberry Pi. Will display basic information like time, calendar, and weather. Will be the platform for future projects.
Debating whether to make it a mirror or just a screen.

## Items needed
* Raspberry Pi
* Frame
* LCD Screen/Monitor
* (Optional) One-way Mirror

## Pros of mirror
* Added level of complexity
* Another use out of it
* Gen would probably find it more interesting and useful

## Cons of mirror
* No real personal need for it
* More expensive
* Annoying smudges

## Suggestions
* Add mirror as Mk 2

### Ideas
* Add Google compatibility to control with current Google Home (very complex)
* Show Spotify activity
* Add touchscreen interface
* Custom Boot Up Screen (Brito does animation)
